  ## Description 

  For this project I have created an application designed for managers to create a site that simply catalogs some important team info. The app uses inquirer and OOP to make an efficient and easy way for a user to access information like github username, and emails, and displays it in a sleek webpage. Learning more about OOP has helped me not only grow my app making skills, but my confidence in javascript and coding overall as well.
